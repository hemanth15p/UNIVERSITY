    <p class= "info" align="justify" style="font-size:20px;"><b>Arthasastra</b> is an ancient Indian treatise on politics, economics, military strategy, and statecraft, attributed to Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, a teacher and advisor of Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire. Arthasastra covers various topics such as administration, diplomacy, law, taxation, welfare, trade, defense, espionage, and war. It advocates a pragmatic and rational approach to governance, based on the principles of dharma (righteousness), artha (material gain), and kama (pleasure). It is considered one of the earliest and most influential works on political science and economics in the world.</p>

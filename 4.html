    <p class= "info" align="justify" style="font-size:20px;"><b>Nitishastra</b> is a collection of moral maxims and political advice written by Baddena, a Telugu poet and a vassal of the Kakatiya queen Rudrama Devi in the 13th century CE1 It is based on the earlier work of Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, who was the mentor of Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauryan Empire2 Nitishastra covers various topics such as ethics, governance, diplomacy, law, economics, and warfare. It also contains stories and examples to illustrate the principles of statecraft and righteous conduct. Some of the popular verses from Nitishastra are:

    <ul class= "info" align="justify" style="font-size:20px; list-style-type: disc">
        <li>Do not act without examining the situation carefully; one ought to act only after scrutinizing the situation carefully. Otherwise, one will have to grieve like the Brahmani (Brahman woman) who killed the mongoose.</li>
        <li>One cannot earn or retain wealth without undergoing suffering. There is suffering in earning wealth as well as in spending it. Is not wealth the home of suffering?</li>
        <li>A student acquires quarter of knowledge from the teacher, a quarter from self study, a quarter from classmates and the final quarter in course of time.</li>
        <li>When a girl is getting married, the father of the girl looks for education in the bride groom; the mother for wealth, the kith and kin for family reputation and the girl for beauty</li>
        </ul>

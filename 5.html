He wrote many books on various subjects, such as logic, physics, biology, ethics, politics, and poetry. He is considered one of the most influential thinkers in the history of Western civilization. He founded the Lyceum, a school and research center in Athens, where he developed his own philosophical system, known as Aristotelianism.
